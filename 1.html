It originated from the Latin word ballare, which means dancing, and is also translated into folk songs and songs. It was passed down from generation to generation with talks such as hero legends and love stories that occurred in the people about literature centered on churches and courts. In the 12th century, minstrel poets were born in southern France, which soon spread to England and became very popular in the 15th and 16th centuries.At first, it was sung to the dance, and the poem format <p>usually consisted of three verses, each of which is characterized by seven to eight lines, and the end 1 to 2 lines are repeated. However, by the 14th century, it was solidified to simply mean a soseo epic poem of Jeong Hyeong.Dante and Petrarcha in Italy and Cost and Maro in France wrote works in this form, while many works were made in England based on history and legends, and in Germany, they were introduced by Herder.In the late 18th century, writers from each country became interested in folk songs, and many ballads were written by Goethe and Heine in Germany, Hugo in France, and Scott in England.</p><p>Dance is the original and fundamental form of expression of human emotions. The spirits of Nude were intended by Carpo to emphasize this primality. This excessive sexual exposure was not welcomed in Paris in the 19th century. The public was shocked by Carpo's bold and realistic female nudity, evaluating it as obscene and inappropriate, and pouring ink into the sculpture.However, after Carpo's death in 1870, the controversy ended, and Carpo's "Dance" eventually served as an opportunity for contemporary art to be free from social constraints.</p>
